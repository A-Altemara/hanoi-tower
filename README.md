# Hanoi Tower
A version of the Monks of Hanoi challenge where the user can select the number of stones to move between 3 posts and walk through the solutions. The console shows the number of steps and actions to the solutions.

Road Map:
- Clean up the UI and UX to look a bit more polished and centered on the screen
- Add options to change colors of stones or randomze them for better experience
- imporove general asthetics of the game
